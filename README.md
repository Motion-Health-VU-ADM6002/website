## Environment Setup

### Installing Git

Git is a version control system that you need to work with this repository. If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from the official website:

[Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Installing Node.js

Node.js is required to run the project and its dependencies. You can download and install Node.js from the official website:

[Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/)

## Repository Setup

### Cloning the Repository

To start working with the Website project, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Website.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### Installing Node Modules

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js modules by running the following command:

```bash
cd Website
npm install
```

### Running the Application

After installing the Node modules, you can start the project by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run an Express server for local development at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Repository Management

### Adding, Committing, and Pushing Code

When working on this repository, please follow these best practices:

- Add, commit, and push your changes frequently.
- Use descriptive commit messages that relate to the work you've done.

Example workflow:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature: description"
git push
```

### Branching Strategy

We use branches to isolate different lines of development. A branch is a separate copy of the project where you can work on specific features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Here's why we use branches:

- **Isolation:** Branches keep different lines of development separate, reducing conflicts and ensuring that changes can be developed independently.

- **Organization:** Branches provide a structured way to work on features, hotfixes, and bug fixes.

- **Collaboration:** Multiple team members can work on different branches simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

#### Creating a Branch

To create a new branch, use the following command, replacing `feature/new-feature` with your branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

#### Checking Out a Branch

To switch to an existing branch, use the following command, replacing `feature/existing-feature` with the branch you want to work on:

```bash
git checkout feature/existing-feature
```

#### Merging Branches

To merge changes from one branch into another, use the following commands:

1. Checkout the branch where you want to merge changes (e.g., `develop` or `main`).

```bash
git checkout develop
```

2. Merge the changes from your feature branch.

```bash
git merge feature/your-feature
```

3. Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.

4. Commit the merged changes.

Now, your changes are integrated into the target branch.

## How to Run the Project

### Local Development Server

The project runs an Express server for local development at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Project Structure

- All website content is located in the `www` folder.
- Developers can clone other repositories with JavaScript games into the `www` folder.
- The `index.html` file in the `www` folder serves as the initial page and redirects users to `/game/`.

### Index Page and Game

When you access the project, you will be redirected to the subfolder `/game/`, where you can experience the JavaScript game.

Feel free to contribute to the Website project by following the guidelines mentioned in this readme. Happy coding!
